# Android Java Reflection
A playground / example where you can load (dexified) jar files on the android app and do reflection stuff in it.

### Note:
To generate the dexified jar file, run the gradle task named `buildDexJar`, or if you use the command line, do:
```
./gradlew buildDexJar
```
> Note for this note: If you're using windows, replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`
